    "But there were almost no buyers. Everybody was suddenly desperate for cash.\n",
    "He and the deputy, asset-management executive Cyrus Taraporevala, had spoken\n",
    "the night before, wrestling with how investors would respond to an emergency\n",
    "interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n",
    "Now, they had their answer. In his 34 years in ﬁnance, Mr. O’Hanley had\n",
    "weathered plenty of meltdowns, but never one like this.\n",
    "“The market is fearing the worst,” Mr. O’Hanley told him.\n",
    "March 16 was the day a microscopic virus brought the ﬁnancial system to the\n",
    "brink. Few realized how close it came to going over the edge entirely.\n",
    "The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 13% that day, the secondbiggest one-day fall in history. Stock-market volatility spiked to a record high.\n",
    "Investors struggled to unload even safe bonds, like Treasurys. Companies and\n",

    "The ﬁnancial system has endured numerous credit crunches and market crashes,\n",
    "and memories of the 1987 and 2008 crises set a high bar for market dysfunction.\n",
    "But longtime investors and those who make a living on Wall Street say mid-March\n",
    "of this year was far more severe in a short period. Moreover, the stresses to the\n",
    "ﬁnancial system were broader than many had seen.\n",
    "“The 2008 ﬁnancial crisis was a car crash in slow motion,” said Adam Lollos, head\n",
    "of short-term credit at Citigroup Inc. “This was like, ‘Boom!’ ”\n",
    "A barrage of government programs has since pulled the system back from\n",

    "markets have ever seen, from many of the executives, money managers and Wall\n",
    "Street veterans who lived it, shows why the rescue eﬀort was so urgent.\n",
    "The Federal Reserve set the stage for the downturn on Sunday, March 15. Most\n",
    "investors were expecting the central bank to announce its latest response to the\n",
    "crisis the following Wednesday. Instead, it announced at 5 p.m. that evening that\n",
    "it was slashing interest rates and planning to buy $700 billion in bonds to help\n",
    "unclog the markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than take comfort in the Fed’s actions, many companies, governments,\n",
    "bankers and investors viewed the decision as reason to prepare for the worst\n",
    "possible outcome from the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
    "A downdraft in bonds was now a rout.\n",
    "Mr. O’Hanley was in a good position to see the crisis unfold. His bank provides\n",
    "vital, if unheralded, administrative and bookkeeping services for most of the\n",
    "world’s biggest investors, and runs its own trillion-dollar money manager.\n",
    "Companies and pension managers have\n",
    "long relied on money-market funds that\n",
    "invest in short-term corporate and\n",
    "municipal-debt holdings considered safe\n",
    "and liquid enough to be classiﬁed as\n",
    "“cash equivalents.” They function almost\n",

    "manage payroll, pay oﬃce leases and\n",
    "move cash around to ﬁnance their daily\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "But that Monday, investors no longer\n",
    "believed certain money funds were cashlike at all. As they pulled their money\n",
    "out, managers struggled to sell bonds to\n",
    "meet redemptions.\n",
    "In theory, there should have been some\n",
    "give in the system. U.S. regulators had\n",
    "rewritten the rules on money funds in\n",
    "\n",
    "the wake of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, replacing their ﬁxed, $1 price with a ﬂoating\n",
    "one that moved with the value of their holdings. The changes headed oﬀ the panic\n",
    "that could ensue when a fund’s price “breaks the buck,” as one prominent fund\n",
    "had in 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But the rules couldn’t stop a panicked assault like this one. Rumors circulated that\n",
    "some of State Street’s rivals would be forced to prop up their funds. Within days,\n",
    "both Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. stepped in to\n",
    "buy assets from their money funds. Both ﬁrms declined to comment.\n",
    "This was bad news for not only those funds and their investors, but also for the\n",
    "thousands of companies and communities dependent on short-term loan markets\n",
    "to pay their employees. “If junk bonds back up, people can rationalize that away,”\n",
    "Mr. O’Hanley said. “There’s very little ability to rationalize trouble in cash.”\n",
    "A debt-investing unit of Prudential Financial Inc., one of the largest insurance\n",
    "companies in the world, was also struggling with normally safe securities.\n",
    "When traders at PGIM Fixed Income tried that Monday to sell a batch of shortterm bonds issued by highly rated companies, they found few takers. And banks\n",
    "were reluctant to step in as intermediaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The broker-dealer community was frozen,” said Michael Collins, a senior ﬁxedincome manager at PGIM. “It was as bad as at any point during the great ﬁnancial\n",
    "crisis.”\n",
    "Across the country in Southern California, the head of the debt-trading desk at\n",
    "investment ﬁrm Capital Group Cos., Vikram Rao, tried to make sense of the\n",
    "dysfunction.\n",
    "Mr. Rao, who was working remotely that Monday, walked down the 20 steps to his\n",
    "home oﬃce at 4:30 a.m. to discover the debt markets were already in disarray. He\n",
    "started calling the senior Wall Street executives he knew at many of the big banks.\n",
    "Executives told him that Sunday’s emergency Fed rate cut had swung a swath of\n",
    "interest-rate swap contracts in banks’ favor. Companies had locked in superlow\n",
    "interest rates on future debt sales over the past year. But when rates fell even\n",
    "further, the companies suddenly owed additional collateral.\n",
    "On that Monday, banks had to account for all that new collateral as assets on their\n",
    "books.\n",
    "So when Mr. Rao called senior executives for an explanation on why they wouldn’t\n",
    "trade, they had the same refrain: There was no room to buy bonds and other\n",
    "assets and still remain in compliance with tougher guidelines imposed by\n",
    "regulators after the previous ﬁnancial crisis. In other words, capital rules\n",
    "intended to make the ﬁnancial system safer were, at least in this instance,\n",
    "draining liquidity from the markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One senior bank executive leveled with\n",
    "him: “We can’t bid on anything that adds\n",
    "to the balance sheet right now.”\n",
    "At the same time, the surge in stockmarket volatility, along with falling\n",
    "prices on mortgage bonds, had forced\n",
    "margin calls on many investment funds.\n",
    "The additional collateral they owed\n",
    "banks was also booked as assets, adding\n",
    "billions more.\n",
    "The slump in mortgage bonds was so\n",
    "vast it crushed a group of investors that\n",
    "had borrowed from banks to juice their\n",
    "returns: real-estate investment funds.\n",
    "The Fed’s bond-buying program,\n",
    "unveiled that Sunday, had earmarked\n",

    "purchases. But by Monday bond\n",
    "\n",
    "while well-intentioned, weren’t nearly\n",

    "For decades investors have eagerly scooped up state and local government bonds\n",
    "month after month, week after week, every week. But that came to a standstill in\n",
    "mid-March.\n",
    "Terriﬁed investors ditched municipal debt at ﬁre-sale prices, underwriters\n",
    "canceled billions of dollars worth of deals and new borrowing stopped. There was\n",
    "less bond issuance in the week of March 16 than at any point during the 2008\n",
    "ﬁnancial crisis, the 2001 terrorist attacks or the week of 1987’s Black Monday,\n",
    "according to Reﬁnitiv data, adjusted for inﬂation.\n",
    "For those few days in March, investors lost faith in America’s public\n",

    "transit systems emptied out, the market began to question what had been\n",

    "The deep trouble in the market was clear early on the morning of March 16.\n",
    "Cities and states often rely on short-term debt issued through bond dealers, who\n",
    "then resell the securities to investors. Billions of dollars of that paper was up for\n",

    "“It’s one of those days where you just go home and say ‘It’s either going to be beer\n",

    "that the bonds eventually sold, largely thanks to government programs that\n",
    "brought markets back from the brink.\n",
    "The liquidity panic quickly leaked into the stock market. Thomas Peterﬀy,\n",

    "5%, the most allowed in a single session.\n",
    "By the time Mr. Peterﬀy started work on Monday morning from his home in Palm\n",
