# NLP_experiments

I am using an NLP code that uses embeddings in Glove to summarize a Wall Street Journal article that I know very well.
This is in the notebook codeA_0.ipynb where 'A' stands for advanced.
I use the code in this site:

For comparison, I am doing the same exercise but this time using a python library that does tokenization.
This is in the notebook code_0.ipynb
I use the code in this site:
https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/12/31/text-summarization-with-python/


The data set is a pdf article from wsj converted to text using https://pdftotext.com/

The advanced code does an amazing job of summarization.

So, even without understanding the implementation details, it is possible to use NLP & achieve practical results.

Perhaps one could optimize the pipeline: in my case, I just converted pdf to text, and then pasted the text output in one cellzinof the jupyter notebook.

This experiment is intended as a starting point. Even so I can envisage using it on many articles I have collected and it will help me summarizing better.

# Next steps

Remove  newline (\n) characters in the text file as follows:
sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/ /g' foo.txt > foo_output.txt

Use T5 Transformer from John Snow Lab as shown here: https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/streamlit_notebooks/T5TRANSFORMER.ipynb
